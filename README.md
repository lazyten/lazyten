# linalgwrap [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/linalgwrap/linalgwrap.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/linalgwrap/linalgwrap)
A lightweight linear algebra wrapper library adding support for lazy matrix evaluation to existing linear algebra libraries.

More documentation will follow shortly. 

Note that this library is at a very early stage at the moment. Interfaces can change and probably not very many compiler / system setups actually work.
